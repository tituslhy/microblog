This is my first foray into fullstack web development. This website is a microblog made using python's flask and MongoDB, and deployed onto render.com. <br>

To run this project, run the following command to instantiate the code environment.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notes
Do note that you will need a MongoDB account and this will need to be kept in a .env file. To create a MongoDB account, visit [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).
